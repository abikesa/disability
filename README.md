To the Johns Hopkins Medicine community

Dear Colleagues,

October is National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM), a time to raise awareness about disability employment issues and to celebrate the contributions of employees with disabilities. One in four adults in the United States — 27% of the population — has a disability. A disability may be a long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory (such as hearing or vision) impairment, which may hinder their full and effective participation in society. 

We are honored to recognize this year’s theme, Advancing Access and Equity, and pay tribute to the accomplishments of our valued faculty and staff members, trainees and patients with disabilities by promoting relevant activities throughout the month. Meet Johns Hopkins NDEAM Achievers Award winners, and learn how they contribute to their jobs and their communities.

Last fall, the Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Health Equity launched the Johns Hopkins Medicine Disability Inclusion and Accessibility Task Force to guide the direction of resources to increase accessibility and organize events promoting disability inclusion. The task force’s efforts include building infrastructure to collect patients’ disability status and respond to their accommodation needs, which will further ensure that we are providing equitable care and complying with ADA regulations. 

Ways to participate this month include: 

On Oct. 5, from noon to 1 p.m., join the Employees with Disabilities Employee Resource Group & Allies for a panel discussion, "How Disabilities Have Impacted the Career Paths of Johns Hopkins Employees." Register here.
Moderator: Barbara Reis (Johns Hopkins Health System)
Panel Participants: Ro Bowman, ERG co-chair (Howard County Medical Center), Annie Embertson (Johns Hopkins Hospital), Joyce Maygers (Bayview Medical Center) and Kris Maxfield (Johns Hopkins Health System)

On Oct. 19, from noon to 1:00 p.m., join JHM Language Services for a “Lunch and Learn: Real Strategies When Working with the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHoH).” There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to evaluating and meeting the language needs of our DHoH patients and their care partners. Are you interested to find out more about the DHoH patient population that we serve? Do you want to be knowledgeable about the resources available to support their language needs? Register here. 
Moderator: Avegrace Maraña (Training Specialist, JHM Language Services) 
Presenters: Tina Tolson (Senior Director, JHM Language Services) and Susana Velarde (Assistant Director of Operations, JHM Language Services)
